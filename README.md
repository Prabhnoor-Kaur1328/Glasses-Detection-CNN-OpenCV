# Glasses Detection using CNN and OpenCV 🤓

## Overview
This project implements a real-time glasses detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. The model detects faces from live camera input and classifies whether a person is wearing glasses or not.

## Model
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Binary classification: Glasses / No Glasses
- Trained on labeled facial images

## Features
- Live camera detection using OpenCV
- Face-based glasses classification
- Real-time bounding box and label display

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN, OpenCV
